When defining a variable, you don't actually need to state its type explicitly when it can be deduced from the initializer:

auto b = true;   // a boolean
auto h = 'x';    // a char 
auto i = 123;    // a int 
auto d = 1.2     // a double 
auto z = sqrt(y) // x has the type of whatever sqrt(y) returns;
